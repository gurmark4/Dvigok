wearing purple neon halos picketed the triditorium  a child lay dead in the gutter and a haughty indian stood beside his glistening taj answering the questions of a servile traffic policeman in a bored and impatient voice        in here  mr  smith     dake said  glad to get the man off the street     they rode up in the groaning elevator  and walked down the hall to the office  darwin branson got up quickly from behind his desk  dake felt a warm assurance at 
seeing the man  felt an end to his own doubts     the conference began  dake was so accustomed to hearing the gentle assurance with which branson wheedled that he listened with half an ear  he suddenly focused his full  shocked attention on darwin branson when he heard him say  a bit coldly    naturally  if all the arrangements please your leader  president enfield wishes your leader to     ah     remember us with friendliness        dake said    darwin  good lord  that implies that we   re             please 
    branson said with soft authority  dake became reluctantly silent  telling himself that branson had some good motive for handling this interview on a different tone and level than all the others     smith smiled    i was afraid  after listening to your young friend  mr  branson  that i would find myself dealing with a saint  i am glad to detect a     shall we say     practical approach           this country  mr  smith  can   t affordnot to make friends  particularly with a coalition as powerful as 
yours           could i safely say then  that those concessions we make shall be more     ah     spectacular than effective        dake had never seen quite that smile on darwin branson   s face before     please  mr  smith  you must remember that we are gentlemen of sincerity and integrity  think how president gondohl lahl would be annoyed should he begin to think that whereas his concessions were made honestly  yours were made with a view to appearances        smith nodded    i see what you mean  we 
must  above all else  be sincere  now i am wondering if     your other dealings  with garva and with chu  have been made with this same degree of sincerity  i think that is a fair question           of course  mr  smith  i will say this  they are all hoping that it is not     too good to be true           i believe     said smith     that i shall offer an alternate concession to the one you ask for  i believe we shall surrender gibraltar to spain 
          eyewash     dake said hotly     that means nothing  you can have missile stations zeroed in on it to immunize it any instant you feel like it        smith looked at branson and raised one eyebrow  branson said    don   t underestimate his offer  dake           but it   s so obvious  you   ve said a hundred times  darwin  that each concession has to be real and honest  or the whole thing will fall down  when everyone else sees that irania is just making a     pointless gesture 
instead of a real concession  they   ll withdraw their promises and we   ll be back where we were           your young man seems to be filled with childish faith  mr  branson           an attribute of most young men  i   m afraid  i   ll relay your offer to the others  mr  smith           and spoil a year   s work  darwin     dake said dully     i     just don   t understand        branson stood up    can we assist you further  mr  smith           no thank you  arrangements have been made 
for me  i   ll be in alexandria in the morning  and  i assure you  the leader will not forget your     cooperation        smith bowed first to branson and then  a bit mockingly  to dake lorin  he left quietly     the moment the door shut  dake said    you   ve blown it  darwin  you   ve blown it sky high        branson leaned back  he looked weary  but satisfied    i think i   ve handled it in the only possible way  dake  it has become increasingly obvious to 
me that we couldn   t ever bring them all together           but yesterday you said             things have happened between yesterday and now  things i can   t explain to you  we   ve had to lower our sights  dake  that smith is an oily specimen  isn   t he  but he   s the representative of irania  oil reserves  dake  a tremendous backlog of manpower  and influence gradually extending down into africa  down into vast resources  they   ll be good friends  dake  good friends to have 
          now slow up just a minute  that is the kind of thinking  darwin  we have both openly said we detest  opportunistic  blind thinking  lining up with the outfit which seems to have the biggest muscles  damn it all  this is an about face which i can   t comprehend           when one plan looks as if it will fail  you pick the next best  that   s mature thinking  dake           nuts  my friend  it   s an evidence of a desire to commit suicide  you 
 of all the people in the world  to suddenly turn out to be             watch it  dake           i won   t watch it  i gave a year of my life to this  and now i find that all along you   ve been giving me the big one world yak  and the brotherhood of man yak  while without letting me know you   ve been setting us up for a power deal           a power deal  my young friend  is the best that an indigent nation 
can hope for  we have to line up with the people who can hit the quickest and the hardest  i     think we   ve managed it           you   ve managed it  leave me out of it  i   m through  darwin  you   ve tried your best to drag me into it  to assume that somehow     merely through being here with you     i become some kind of     partner  it was more than a dream  for god   s sake           remember how the british survived for so 
long  dake  after they   d lost their muscles  always creating that delicate balance of power and             ending in hell  darwin  when the indians threw them out of fiji  when all the throats in the solomons were cut  i can   t seem to get through to you  we weren   t doing this for us  we were doing it for the world at large  darwin           sometimes it is wise to accept half a loaf        dake lorin felt the tingling tension in all his
